# emailAutomator
To be used by the Rodin Resource Room Staff to automate outgoing emails for overdue loaned items

This program should use webscraping to determine how long an item has been checked out send an email if it is overdue. 

If an item is overdue it will send a customized email to the penn-registered email of whoever needs to return it by gathering
information from the website, specifically: the name of the item(s), the individual's penn key (beginning of email), 
the date of check out, the original date of return, and the number of offenses. 

Email templates have been provided by the staff for each case we'd need to reach out.
